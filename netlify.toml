[build]
  # Netlify will publish the static site from the `templates` folder
  publish = "templates"
  # No build command for this simple static site; set one if you add a build step later
  command = ""

[dev]
  # Local dev server functions folder (use Netlify CLI `netlify dev` to test functions)
  functions = "netlify/functions"

# Note:
# - This configuration publishes the `templates/` directory which contains the site's
#   `index.html`. If your site requires a build step (for example a bundler, SSG, or
#   a framework) set `command` to the build command and change `publish` to the
#   directory the build produces (for example `dist/` or `build/`).
# - Netlify's native Functions runtime supports JavaScript/Go out of the box. To run
#   Python-based serverless functions on Netlify you must use a build plugin or
#   container-based approach. If you rely on `api/index.py` (Vercel-style), consider
#   moving server code to a separate server or converting to a Netlify Function.
